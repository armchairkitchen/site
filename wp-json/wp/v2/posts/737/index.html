I was lucky to have some published in The Times, The Telegraph, the Financial Times and a paper which only exists as a free sheet now, The Evening Standard.<\/p>\n<p>At that time (nearly thirty years ago) it was hard to catch an editor&#8217;s eye; specially if they already had their own cookery columnists. That didn&#8217;t stop me thinking up an endless stream of ideas and sending them off. Here is an idea for a book that I found recently, illustrated by my own drawings (which you can see above):<\/p>\n<p>It was to be called <em>&#8216;Just another glossy cookbook&#8217; . <\/em>With the designs I sent a note saying:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Would you like to discuss it with me? I will happily bombard you with glowing criticisms of my past work, more details of the layout with recipe suggestions and some other articles I have been writing which I hope to have published shortly in Taste Magazine.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Since this never made it to print, I must assume that my cheeky request was ignored or refused.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Now I spend my time writing a blog, which has no need to be submitted to an editor. So those of you who follow it <a href=\"http:\/\/www.lookitcookit.tumblr.com\">here <\/a>will know that I can choose what to write about and to give my own opinions, without being told &#8216;Not for us, thank you.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; *<\/p>\n<p>19th November<\/p>\n<p><strong>When to keep quiet<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>These comments are from John Le Carre, famous author of espionage novels (of which he wrote more than 20).<\/p>\n<p>On his personal life:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cI hate the telephone.
