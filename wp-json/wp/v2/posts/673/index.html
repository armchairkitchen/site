There you&#8217;ll find, month by month, a picture of each post I have put up in the past six years.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>When you find a picture that appeals to you, it may have a recipe or a link to one. The recipes I choose are either my own, or the best I can find online.&nbsp; Even better is when I find a video because this is the best way to demonstrate a new dish. For less experienced cooks it&#8217;s far better than reading a description in a book.<\/p>\n<p>So if you see a photo you like and want to know how to make something, do send me a message.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have a collection of over two thousand recipes (including the blog, all my cookbooks and files of cookery notes).
