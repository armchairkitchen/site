When I discovered this I began to tailor the blog to their needs: how they can find out about great food and learn to cook it as simply as possible. Although my preference is for classic French cuisine I realize few people now have the time for complicated techniques, so although I put up pictures of pastries like mille feuilles,&nbsp; I don&#8217;t expect my readers to spend the time creating them.

The first one <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thecameltrail.com\/\">The Camel Trail<\/a> won an award for best Food Literature Book in the UK when it came out in 2007. The novel evolved from research I was doing into the life of my great grandfather, who was orphaned after an earthquake in the Middle East in 1837.

The category is &#8216;music&#8217; and it was mentioned for both the writing and the design.<\/p>\n<p>My working day is divided into two parts: writing fiction and thinking about food. Four times a week I add photos and posts to my food blog. This is my way of keeping up with what is happening in the food world and simplifying the cooking by bringing it to a new generation of cooks who almost certainly don&#8217;t have the time that I have to create and prepare new and classic dishes.<\/p>\n<h4>Personal<\/h4>\n<p>Apart from writing and cooking, I like film, restaurants, art and travel. The last of these is necessary as well as pleasurable since three of our four sons live far away. I am married to Michael Jackson, an expert in computer software, also known as The Man in the Armchair Kitchen, as his other role is chief taster for the food I cook.&nbsp; We have the four sons, four American daughters in law and thirteen grandchildren, ranging in age from 30 to 6.<\/p>\n<p>Welcome to The Armchair Kitchen.
