										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What&#8217;s happening in The Armchair Kitchen?</p>
<p>This week I&#8217;ve been thinking about books and what I&#8217;ve read recently.&nbsp; Here is a non-fiction book that made an impression.</p>
<p><strong>NEGOTIATION by Gavin Presman</strong></p>
<p>This is a self-help book; an engaging, page-turning explanation of how to come out of a business deal with both sides happy.&nbsp; The author starts by differentiating between haggling and negotiating. He gives advice about listening, discussing, bargaining and finally agreeing. What&#8217;s interesting about this book is that his techniques, honed on concluding business deals &#8211; whether it&#8217;s buying a house or setting terms at a job interview &#8211; include the most basic necessity: how to negotiate with family.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Real collaboration with someone else is often accompanied by a warm connected and grounded feeling. If this feeling isn&#8217;t present we can ask ourselves whether we are really in the right state of mind to negotiate with another person.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>This book is for anyone who has come up against conflict. Presman gives us the skills we need to navigate many aspects of our lives.</p>
<p>Negotiation by Gavin Presman is available to buy on Amazon.</p>
