In the twelve years since then I have written more than&nbsp; three thousand posts, illustrated with my own photos. There is no more rambling about anything I thought funny, it is focused. My aim now is to reach those who don&#8217;t have time for complicated cooking, but still appreciate the odd bit of &#8216;haute cuisine&#8217; among the hints and suggestions for how to get a meal on the table after a day at work. So I find the best online recipe or video, I do the cooking.
