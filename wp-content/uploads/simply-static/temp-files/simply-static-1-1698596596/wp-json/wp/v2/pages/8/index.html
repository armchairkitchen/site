In an interview the late Margaret Forster was asked how she spent her day. Her reply was: <em>&#8216;In the morning I write, in the afternoon I go for walks and in the evening I read.&#8217;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>For those engaged in social media, grappling with too many emails or tweets, this sounds enviably delightful. But while I wondered at Forster&#8217;s concentration, I later learned that she spent six months of the year in the Lake District, far from family or friends.&nbsp; I also read, write and walk, but these are the only ways in which I am similar to the great novelist.<\/p>\n<p>For some years I have been keeping a note of every book I read. This is usually a page of comment opposite some quotations written in a large leather bound book. <img data-attachment-id=\"253\" data-permalink=\"https:\/\/thearmchairkitchen.com\/books\/img_5628-1\/\" data-orig-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thearmchairkitchen.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_5628-1.jpg?fit=640%2C462&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"640,462\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon PowerShot SD770 IS&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1484583266&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;6.2&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;125&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.01&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"IMG_5628 (1)\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thearmchairkitchen.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_5628-1.jpg?fit=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thearmchairkitchen.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_5628-1.jpg?fit=640%2C462&amp;ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-253\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thearmchairkitchen.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_5628-1.jpg?resize=300%2C217\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" srcset=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thearmchairkitchen.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_5628-1.jpg?resize=300%2C217&amp;ssl=1 300w, https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/thearmchairkitchen.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/12\/IMG_5628-1.jpg?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" \/>The reason I do this is because I often forget details (or sometimes even the plot or the characters) so when the film of a novel comes out, I happily refer back to my notes to remind me, so I can compare the book with the screen version.<\/p>\n<p>I shall shortly be recommending books I have read and enjoyed.
